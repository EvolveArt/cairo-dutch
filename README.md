# üá≥üá± cairo-dutch

A Dutch Auction written in [Cairo](https://cairo-lang.org/docs/) for StarkNet. Ported after studying [a reference implementation](https://solidity-by-example.org/app/multi-sig-wallet/) from solidity-by-example.

A Gradual Dutch Auction has also been added for Starknet. It refers to a new type of Dutch Auction created by [Paradigm Research](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/04/gda)

Allows configurable duration, discount rate, & ERC20 token type accepted as payment.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This is not intended for production use. The code has barely been tested, let alone audited.

Basic Dutch Auction:

1. Seller of NFT deploys this contract setting a starting price & ERC20 token type accepted.
2. Auction lasts for a configurable number of blocks (`durationBlocks`).
3. Price decreases over time (`discountRate`).
4. Participants can buy if sending ERC20 value greater than or equal to the current price computed by the contract.
5. Auction ends when a buyer buys the NFT or the deadline is reached.
